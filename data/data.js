    Probably the intelectually most stimulating year of my life. Here I learnt about anthropology, episthemology, economics, politics and ethics at a whole new level finding an understanding of things that I have only encountered when studying much simpler problems in physics or math.

    As part of a European exchange program I had the opportunity to study in Netherlands for six months. I enrolled in the first semester classes of the Masters in Theoretical Physics of the University of Groningen.
    </p><br>
    <p>
    At a personal level, the experience made me more confident and willing to embrace situations outside of my confort zone. I gained a new perspective on how life is outside of Spain and the social and cultural environment in The Netherlands.
    <p>
    `,
    `
    <p>
    I studied physics because it was the subject I enjoyed the most at school. I think I enjoyed it because it was the only field in which I could continue making questions and the only blocker for understanding was my ability to structure knowledge in my mind. Here I became aware that there are not many things that cannot be deeply understood. The mind is a powerful tool to build order in chaos and not every answer makes sense.

    As an excercise for the course, I had to build a <a href = "${projects[0].link}" class = "description-link" target = "_blank">web</a> that displayed images based on a third-party REST API.
    </p><br>
    <p>
    The constraints of the project were to use <a href = "https://unsplash.com/" class = "description-link" target = "_blank">Unsplash's</a> API and load in our page high resolution images. We had to replicate Pinterest UI simplified and add the functionalities we considered. I added a search bar that uses the user's input to make a request to the API through a query, a refresh button to load new images and the link in each image card to the original image in Unsplash.

    Why can't we access our money through anyone elses phone? Why do we have to be physically present to pay at restaurants or bars? Couldn't we handle P2P debts in a smarter way?
    </p><br>
    <p>
    I'm currently building a mobile app to register <a href = "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zqzJbytJMYFZbBSHq2mGdnGvhmcPdnptkXJf7LAJW5c/mobilepresent?pli=1&slide=id.p" class = "description-link" target = "_blank">shared payments</a>. The idea is to handle payments within my close friends and eliminate the friction of paying for someone else and receiving the money back later on.
    </p><br>
    <p>
    The MVP aims to validate if a reminder system based on an app where the user records the payments is useful for him. If the user feels happy with knowing who owes who, maybe he won't feel the need to claim the debts immediately and a P2P debt network could make sense.
    </p><br>
    <p>
    To eliminate friction in introducing the data, the app should be triggered when the Near Field Communication (NFC) tag reader is activated when a payment is made by the Apple wallet in the phone. For this I'm diving into Swift and learning how to use Apple's developer framework.

    I've created this website with the goal of differenciating my profile from anyother on Linkedin. I want to use this site to share it and keep track of the projects I work on. I want it to be a project in continous development and work on improving it as I learn new skills and technologies. Ultimately I want this website to be my profile on the Internet with access to everything I have worked on.
    </p><br>
    <p>
    On top of this, it is very good practise to learn JavaScript and the fundamentals of design and webpage development in Vite :)

    I built the website for an <a href = "${projects[2].link}" class = "description-link" target = "_blank">online vinyl store</a>. The store itself didn't exists and I never wanted to sell anything. The goal was to build the landing page for an ecommerce and focus on aligning the visual design with the type of products sold and with the audience.
    </p><br>
    <p>
    On top of the design, I focused on adding basic ecommerce functionalities like a burger menu at the top right-hand corner of the page and a filter section to interact with the product display.
    </p><br>
    <p>
    In this project I got to learn JavaScript and put it into practise for the search and filter sections.

    In April 2023 I started a <a href = "https://www.rockthecode.es/new/" class = "description-link" target = "_blank">bootcamp</a> focused on learning to code webapps. I had coded in university basic scripts in Python and Matlab before, however this was my first experience building something with code and delivering an end result which someone could interact with.
    </p><br>
    <p>
    This first project in the bootcamp was focused on building a <a href = "${projects[3].link}" class = "description-link" target = "_blank">landing page</a> for an ecommerce. The project guidelines suggested to replicate <a href = "https://www.pccomponentes.com/" class = "description-link" target = "_blank">PC Componente's</a> webpage, however at the moment I was thinking about the problem of unused clothes resting in wardrobes and decided to make the site for a second-hand wedding dresses marketplace.
    </p><br>
    <p>
    This was my first time working with Github and how software projects are built. I also learnt how to make the site mobile responsive.
