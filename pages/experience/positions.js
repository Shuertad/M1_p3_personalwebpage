    Probably the intelectually most stimulating year of my life. Here I learnt about anthropology, episthemology, economics, politics and ethics at a whole new level finding an understanding of things that I have only encountered when studying much simpler problems in physics or math.

    As part of a European exchange program I had the opportunity to study in Netherlands for six months. I enrolled in the first semester classes of the Masters in Theoretical Physics of the University of Groningen.
    </p><br>
    <p>
    At a personal level, the experience made me more confident to show myself to new people and embrace situations outside of my confort zone. I learnt a lot, had fun, met new intresting people and learnt how to ride a bike with no hands :)
    <p>
    `,
    `
    <p>
    I studied physics because it was the subject I enjoyed the most at school. I think I enjoyed it because it was the only field in which I could continue making questions and the only blocker for understanding was my ability to structure knowledge in my mind. Here I became aware that there are not many things that cannot be deeply understood. The mind is a powerful tool to build order in chaos and not every answer makes sense.
