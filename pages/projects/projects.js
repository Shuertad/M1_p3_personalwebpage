    I've created this website with the goal of differenciating my profile from anyother on Linkedin. I want to use this site to share it and keep track of the projects I work on. I want it to be a project in continous development and work on improving it as I learn new skills and technologies. Ultimately I want this website to be my profile on the Internet with access to everything I have worked on.
    </p><br>
    <p>
    On top of this, it is very good practise to learn JavaScript and the fundamentals of design and webpage development in Vite :)

    I built the website for an online vinyl store. The store itself didn't exists and I never wanted to sell anaything. The goal was to build the landing page for an ecommerce and focus on aligning the visual design with the type of products sold and the audience.
    </p><br>
    <p>
    On top of the design, I focused on adding basic ecommerce functionalities like a burger menu at the top right-hand corner of the page and a filter section to interact with the product display.
    </p><br>
    <p>
    In this project I got to learn JavaScript and put it into practise for the search and filter sections.

    In April 2023 I started a <a href = "https://www.rockthecode.es/new/" class = "description-link">bootcamp</a> focused on learning to code webapps. I had coded in university basic scripts in Python and Matlab before, however this was my first experience building something with code and delivering an end result which someone could interact with.
    </p><br>
    <p>
    This first project in the bootcamp was focused on building a landing page for an ecommerce. The project guidelines suggested to replicate <a href = "https://www.pccomponentes.com/" class = "description-link">PC Componente's</a> webpage, however at the moment I was thinking about the problem of unused clothes resting in wardrobes and decided to make the site for a second-hand wedding dresses marketplace.

    This was my first time working with Github and how software projects are built. I also learnt how to make the site mobile responsive.
